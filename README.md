CaPIÄ‡ [ ka-peech ] - SAP CAP based assistant for local CPI and camel (SAP flavor) exploration and testing

### Setup and host dependencies
To run this you'll need nodejs and npm

Also as we exec some shell commands (zip/unzip, file operations) you'll need to run on *nix system (or WSL for windows)

You'll also need to have git and curl installed.

As a typical nodejs project, setup/run is trivial:
```
npm i
npm start
```
